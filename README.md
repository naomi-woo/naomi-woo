# 👋 Hi, I'm Naomi Woo!  
`🎯 From raw data to real stories.`


<br/>
A data analyst in the making — with global ambition and a curiosity-driven mindset.

<br/>💡 I recently completed the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and am now diving into portfolio projects to put my skills into action. While I ultimately aim to bridge data and fashion, I’m currently open to all data-related roles that challenge me to grow and expand my expertise.

#### 🌍 My goal?  
To live and work as a **digital nomad**, solving real-world problems with data — anywhere in the world.

<br/>


## 🔭 What I'm focusing on now
- Building hands-on portfolio projects (Capstone in progress!)
- Expanding my skills in data visualization (Tableau)
- Actively applying to **remote and international roles** in data analytics  

<br/>

## 🌱 Interests & Identity
- Data + Fashion 👠📊 (long-term vision, but still exploring broadly)  
- Lifestyle Design & Location Freedom 🏝️💼  
- Media, Language, and Cross-Cultural Identity 🌐  
- Always learning — always iterating 🚀  

<br/>
